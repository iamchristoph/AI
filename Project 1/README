Instructions on use:
 python uninformed.py <optional file name>

If a file name is not provided, the following will be used instead:

test = (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4, 2) 

_13
578
642

The default is to print the last 100 moves of a valid solution. However, depth limited 
search is limited to 21 moves. There is currently no a command line option to change 
these default values. If changes are desired you must look in uninformed.py

The solution is set to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0) 
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 _

Again this can only be changed by looking in uninformed.py
